Essentially, this app turns focus time into a  **digital terrarium** . It gamifies the Pomodoro technique by giving you a visual "living" reward for your concentration.

Here is the quick breakdown of the user experience:

* **Focus & Visualize:** You start a 3-second timer. Instead of just watching numbers tick down, you see a circular progress bar slowly wrapping around a central plant.
* **Incremental Growth:** Each time you complete a full session, the plant physically transforms (e.g., growing leaves or getting taller).
* **The Reward:** After three sessions , the plant reaches its final stage and "blooms" a tomato.
* **The Goal:** It transforms a dry productivity method into a nurturing experience—if you stop working, the garden stops growing.
