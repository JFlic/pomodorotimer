  "product_overview": "Digital Terrarium Pomodoro gamifies the Pomodoro technique by turning focus time into a visual and interactive digital terrarium experience. Users nurture a digital plant that grows incrementally with each completed focus session, enhancing motivation and providing visual feedback on productivity.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Encourage sustained focus through the Pomodoro technique.",
    "Provide visual and interactive feedback to motivate users.",
    "Integrate a gamified plant growth cycle tied to focus sessions.",
    "Allow task management alongside focus sessions via a to-do list.",
    "Reset and manage plant growth stages logically based on user interaction."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Pomodoro timer with play, pause, and reset controls.",
    "Visual plant growth stages represented by images depicting start, middle, and end growth.",
    "Modal popup warning when plant dies triggered by pausing or resetting mid-session, resetting plant growth.",
    "To-do list panel to add, list, and remove tasks with persistence across sessions.",
    "Session completion tracking with progress dots and a harvest feature that resets growth after three sessions, while maintaining to-do tasks.",
    "Clean user interface styled with Tailwind CSS and functional React components for smooth operation."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User opens the app and views the current plant growth stage and a to-do list panel.",
    "User adds tasks to the to-do list using the Enter key and can remove tasks with a trash button.",
    "User starts a 25-minute Pomodoro timer; a circular progress bar visually represents remaining time.",
    "Upon completion of a session, the plant image advances to the next growth stage and session count increments.",
    "If the user pauses or resets the timer mid-session, a modal popup 'Your plant died!' alerts the user and resets the plant growth stage to start.",
    "After completing three full sessions, the plant blooms fully, and user is prompted to start over with a new seed, resetting session counts and plant stage but preserving the to-do list."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Pomodoro timer starts, pauses, resumes, and resets correctly with accurate countdown.",
    "Plant grows to the next stage only after full sessions are completed, visually updating images as expected.",
    "Modal popup displays and plant resets if user interrupts a session by pausing or resetting mid-cycle.",
    "To-do list accurately adds and removes tasks and persists data on app restart.",
    "Session completion count and progress dots update correctly after each session.",
    "After three sessions, plant growth resets and user prompt appears, with to-do list unaffected.",
    "UI styling matches design specifications and app runs smoothly without errors."
